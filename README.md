# Sequence-Based Filtering for Visual Route-Based Navigation

This repository provides sequence-based implementations of five Visual Place Recognition (VPR) techniques â€” <b>AMOSNet</b>, <b>HybridNet</b>, <b>CALC</b>, <b>HOG</b>, and <b>NetVLAD</b> â€” as described in the accompanying paper.

**Title:** Sequence-Based Filtering for Visual Route-Based Navigation: Analyzing the Benefits, Trade-Offs and Design Choices <br>
**Authors:** Mihnea-Alexandru Tomita, Mubariz Zaffar, Bruno Ferrarini, Michael J. Milford, Klaus D. McDonald-Maier and Shoaib Ehsan 

Published in IEEE Access, vol. 10, pp. 81974-81987, 2022 and available ðŸ“‘ [here](https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3196389).

The goal of this work is to systematically investigate the effects of sequence-based filtering on top of single-frame-based VPR techniques for route-based navigation. We analyze the trade-offs between accuracy and computational cost, examine the impact of sequence length, and identify combinations of techniques that deliver high performance efficiently.

> **Note:** The sequence-based implementation of RegionVLAD is also provided in this repository for completeness, although it was not evaluated in the paper.

## ðŸ“¦ Pretrained Models

ðŸ“¥ [MODEL_DOWNLOADS.md](MODEL_DOWNLOADS.md) provides the web locations and instructions for downloading all pretrained models required by the VPR techniques in this repository. These files are not included due to size restrictions.

## ðŸ›  Required Libraries By Technique:
- **AMOSNet:** `caffe`, `numpy`, `cv2`, `csv`       
- **CALC:** `caffe`, `numpy`, `cv2`, `csv`, `time`     
- **HOG:** `numpy`, `cv2`, `csv`
- **HybridNet:** `caffe`, `numpy`, `cv2`, `csv`                  
- **NetVLAD:** `tensorflow`, `numpy`, `cv2`, `csv`, `time`
- **RegionVLAD:** `caffe`, `numpy`, `cv2`, `csv`, `skimage`, `pickle`, `itertools`, `time`, `os`           


## ðŸš€ Running the Sequence-Based VPR Techniques
> **Note:** For each VPR technique in this repository, the Python files are named with a `_k` suffix (e.g. `NetVLAD_k.py`). This indicates that the implementation uses sequence-based filtering, where `k` represents the number of consecutive images in each sequence. The value of `k` can be adjusted for each technique. For more details, please refer to the accompanying paper.

Before running any `.py` file, update the following variables:
- `total_Query_Images` â†’ Number of images in the **query folder**.
- `total_Ref_Images` â†’ Number of images in the **reference folder**.
- `query_directory` â†’ Path to your **query images** folder.
- `ref_directory` â†’ Path to your **reference images** folder.
- `k` â†’ Number of consecutive images in the sequence. Set `k = 1` to disable sequence-based filtering.

<pre>
total_Query_Images = 1000  # Number of images in the query folder
total_Ref_Images   = 1000  # Number of images in the reference folder

query_directory = '/path/to/query/images'
ref_directory   = '/path/to/reference/images'

k = 10  # Sequence length
</pre>

Once these variables are correctly set, you can run the corresponding `_k.py` file for your chosen technique.

## ðŸ“Š Datasets
The experiments use the following publicly available sequential VPR datasets:
- Campus Loop
- Gardens Point (day-to-day) 
- Gardens Point (day-to-night) 
- Nordland 

For more details on these datasets, including environmental conditions and experimental setup, please refer to our paper.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Findings
- Sequence-based filtering consistently improves VPR accuracy by leveraging sequences of consecutive images.
- Lightweight descriptors such as HOG or CALC can sometimes outperform deep learning methods like NetVLAD while requiring less computation.
- Deep learning-based methods such as AMOSNet, HybridNet and NetVLAD are more robust under severe environmental and viewpoint changes but require more computational resources.
- Sequence-based matching may fail if the traversal speed between the query and reference sequences differ significantly.
